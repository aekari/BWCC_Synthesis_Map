## Description

[Synthesis Map](https://aekari.github.io/Synthesis-Map/) is a brainstorming tool to help generate creative ideas. The concept of a synthesis map was first introduced to me by Professor [Mark Addison Smith](https://www.ccny.cuny.edu/profiles/mark-addison-smith) of City College of New York and I adapted it for the web, specifically for this project.

## Known Bugs

1. The Map is best used on a desktop and is not responsive/mobile friendly.
2. The images are small without an option to view them larger besides zooming in.
3. There's no way to easily update the photosw/out going into the code and doing it manually.
