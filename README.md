## Description

[Synthesis Map](https://aekari.github.io/Synthesis-Map/) is a brainstorming tool to help generate creative ideas. The concept of a synthesis map was first introduced to me by Professor [Mark Addison Smith](https://www.ccny.cuny.edu/profiles/mark-addison-smith) of City College of New York and I adapted it for the web, specifically for this project.

## Known Bugs

1. It's not mobile friendly. At this point in time The Map is best used on a desktop but I would like for it to be mobile-friendly and responsive on any device (mobile or desktop).
2. The images are small without an option to view them larger, besides zooming in.

In future updates these issues will be fixed.
